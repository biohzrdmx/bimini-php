# bimini-php

Easily check and retrieve BIMI records from a host

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/bimini-php` with Composer.

Then create a `Bimini` instance; for that you must pass an `StorageInterface` implementation and this package includes a simple file system storage adapter named `FileSystemStorage`:

```php
$path = dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'output';
$storage = new FileSystemStorage($path);
$bimini = new Bimi($storage);
```

The `FileSystemStorage` implementation uses a local directory to store the result of the DNS record queries, to minimize network requests; you may also write your own storage adapters for database, Redis, Memcached or any other persistance mechanism, just implement the `StorageInterface` methods.

Now that you have a `Bimini` instance you can query any host, for example you can check for the existence of a record with the `hasRecord` method:

```php
$ret = $bimini->hasRecord('example.com');
```

Or retrieve the complete record with the `getRecord` method:

```php
$record = $bimini->getRecord('example.com');
```

Once you have the record you can check its properties with the `has-` methods (`hasVersion`, `hasLogo`, `hasCertificate`) or retrieve the actual properties with the `get-` methods (`getVersion`, `getLogo`, `getCertificate`), for example:

```php
if ( $record->hasLogo() ) {
    $url = $record->getLogo();
}
```

Actually there is only one BIMI version, so the `getVersion` method should always return `BIMI1` for a valid record.

Both `getLogo` and `getCertificate` methods return a URL to the respective resource (the SVG image or the PEM file). The library does not validate these URLs, it only returns the value stored in the BIMI record; it's up to you if you want to render the SVG file or check the VMC certificate.
